Git-autocommit
What is git-autocommit?
This is a ruby script that watches a project for changes, such as when a file is changed in an editor and saved, and commits that change to the git repository containing that file.
One could perhaps use a hook in your favorite text editor to run git commit whenever you save, but this is completely independent of what tools you use. Any changes, caused by any program, will be noticed and a commit made.
Dependencies
The inotify library is required. This ties the use of git-autocommit to linux, but I’m sure it wouldn’t be too much difficulty to support other OS’s file notification systems, especially if gems already exist wrapping their interfaces.
Explanation and Usage
I find myself not committing my work frequently enough - I tend to wait until a project is in at least a working state, often with a complete feature, before committing. Granted, commits that others see benefit from being as close to working as possible (to make things like git bisect easier to work with), this can prevent me from getting the most benefit from using revision control in the first place.
Here’s my workflow: Before running autocommit, I make sure I’m working on a local topic branch:
git branch new_work
This topic branch will never be seen by anyone else, it’s never pushed to any public repository. This is important, because later, I’ll be modifying the history before making it public. Now, I can run autocommit:
autocommit /path/to/worktree
When I’m done with my work, I now have a large number of commits that were made automatically for me while I wrote, saved, and tested my work. I don’t want to subject others to the minute details changed between saves, so I want to combine groups of commits together. To learn how to do this, read the git book's section on interactive rebasing.
TODO
Currently, this only watches for changes in existing files in the project. I haven’t written the logic to watch directories for the creation of new files, so they won’t be noticed without a restart of autocommit.
Support for platforms other than linux is currently lacking.
Is fsnotify available, and more appropriate?
